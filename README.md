# GettingAndCleaningData

## Instructions before running the .R script
1. Please download the data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the downloaded data to the working directory
3. Set the working directory in R
4. Source the run_analysis.R file to run the script

## Method
Running the run_analysis.R file oes the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
